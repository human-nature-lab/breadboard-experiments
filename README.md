# breadboard-experiments
A public repository of example experiment code for use with breadboard. The code for these examples each exist in their own repository.

If you have an experiment you'd like to submit to this repository, [please contact us](mailto:breadboard@yale.edu).

## Experiments
- [Public Goods Game](https://github.com/human-nature-lab/PublicGoods)
	- This is a public goods game played over repeated rounds. In each round the players will choose to cooperate, pay [coc] points for
each neighbor in order for each neighbor to receive [po] points, or to defect, pay 0 points and not change the score of their neighbors.
- [Coloring Game](https://github.com/human-nature-lab/ColoringGame)
	- In this game players are given the collaborative task of choosing colors such that each player's color is distinct from each of their neighbors. This is an example of an asynchronous game: each player may make choices at any time during the game without waiting for other players.
- [Ultimatum Game](https://github.com/human-nature-lab/UltimatumGame)
	- In this game players are paired up and one player is given the role of 'Proposer' and the other is given the role of 'Responder'. The Proposer takes a sum of points and divides it among themselves and their partner. The Responder can choose to Accept the proposed allocation in which case the players get the allocated points or Reject the proposal in which case neither player gets any points.
